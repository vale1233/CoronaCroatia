# CoronaCroatia
Hello. My name is Valentin and this is my first Python project I did by myself.
Without further ado, let me shortly explain my project.
Name of the project is CoronaCroatia. It is programmed in Python code using PyCharm. Application is showing data about Covid-19 in Croatia.
Application is taking JSON data from official Croatian Covid-19 website. 

After application is being started, tkinter window opens:

Buttons are self explanatory, but you can also see the date of last update of the data. 
For example, when we click on "Active cases by region" button, this graph opens:

And for example I can show last graph for "Croatia death graph per 100.000 people":
